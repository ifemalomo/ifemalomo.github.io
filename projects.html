                <p>I created a dynamically typed version of Ocaml, exhibiting my understanding of the inner workings of programming languages. 
                It also shows my familiarity with functional programming as it was built with a functional programming language, OCaml.

                <a href="Graph Instructions.pdf" >View Project</a>
                <p>Through my Introduction to Data Science class, I became familiar the Python library Matplotlib with the functions necessary to 
                    create visually appealing graphs to more effectively argue for the story the data was telling. I thought
                    students taking the class today would find a lot of value in instructions on this, since it isn't explicitly taught in the course.

                <p>In my Introduction to Machine Learning class, I learned about how various machine learning algorithms can be implemented through code. I 
                    put this into practive in using Python to classify different colors into a set number of distinct
                    representative colors that can reduce the amount of data it takes to store a picture.</p>

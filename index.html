                        <p>Hello, my name is Ife Malomo. As a junior undergraduate at the University of Maryland 
                            studying computer science on the data science track, I’ve become proficient in 
                            object-oriented programming along with algorithms and data structures. 
                            Using Python and Pandas, I’ve synthesized findings from querying databases and created 
                            reports on them. I’m excited to learn more about the software development process and 
                            create tools that can improve the lives of others.

                <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
                <p>I started learning to program when I joined the Johns Hopkins University STEM Academy. There, I learned the 
                    basics of Python and MATLAB as well as the beginnings of Social Network Analysis. Both intrigued me; solving 
                    problems in Python felt like figuring out a puzzle, and it amazed me how something as complex as a community
                     could be condensed and analyzed with just mathematical algorithms. I joined Johns Hopkins’ internship 
                     program, and got to talk with professionals in the computer science field, which encouraged me to pursue a 
                     career in computer science myself.<br><br>As I entered college, I continued searching for opportunities to 
                     explore the different aspects of computer science. I took particular interest in data science, from that 
                     formative STEM Academy class. I interned with STEER Tech, a company creating autonomous vehicles capable of 
                     recognizing obstacles from sensors, and interviewed my colleagues to understand the science behind it, and 
                     how the principles I learned in my classes related. Since then, I’ve taken Introduction to Data Science and 
                     Introduction to Machine Learning, so I could better conceptualize the calculations the cars’ autonomous 
                     systems were making and implement similar algorithms.<br><br>Beyond data science, I’ve strived to explore many 
                     different avenues of computer science. In my first internship with Johns Hopkins, I worked on front-end app 
                     development with my mentor, using Python and the PyQt5 library. I expanded my breadth of knowledge in my 
                     Technica fellowship before my freshman year of college, learning HTML and CSS for front-end web development 
                     and creating this website as my capstone. Then, as a fellow in the IBM accelerate program, I familiarized 
                     myself with back-end web development using JavaScript. I’m still exploring different possibilities of a 
                     career in computer science, and picking up knowledge of many different sectors as I go.</p>

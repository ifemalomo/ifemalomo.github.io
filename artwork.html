                <img src="Walk a Mile.jpg" alt="drawing of a sneaker surrounded by grass and dandelion seeds">
                <p>Artist Statement (from 12/13/18): The memory I was drawing was in kindergarten when my friend and I
                     tried to make wishes by blowing on dandelions but we ended up inhaling the seeds which 
                     left us coughing and sputtering. It’s one of the few memories I have about kindergarten
                      which makes the memory valuable to me.  The dandelion seeds are self-explanatory. The
                       swing-set chains were nearby as we were at recess, but we were standing on the grass 
                       when making wishes. When I was in kindergarten, my private school had us wear uniforms
                        which is why I added the plaid fabric. </p>

                <img src="Work Play.jpg" alt="dark purple mountain topped by a yellow swirling streamer">
                <p>Artist Statement (from 3/5/20): I responded to the prompt of work versus play by creating a
                     representation in my mind of the struggles of getting through work to enjoy play. The dark
                      colored mountain represents the task of completing all the work you have to do to get to
                       play, which is represented by the yellow ribbon. I elevated the ribbon with the wire to
                        make it apparent that even when you’re finished with all the work of the day, play is 
                        still out of reach. </p>
